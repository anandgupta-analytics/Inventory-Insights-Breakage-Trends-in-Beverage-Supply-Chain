**Inventory Analytics & Breakage Trends – Beverage Supply Chain**

**Project Title**:
Inventory Insights & Breakage Trends in Beverage Supply Chain
Course Project – SCH-MGMT 663: Supply Chain Analytics, UMass Amherst

**Overview**:
This project focuses on inventory optimization and breakage trend analysis for Alcohol Beverage Services (ABS) using real supply chain data. The objective was to explore patterns in breakage, identify overstock risks, evaluate pricing and discount trends, and assess the feasibility of merging inventory and incident datasets for deeper business insights.

**Objectives**:
• Analyze inventory and breakage patterns to identify cost drivers and operational gaps
• Explore seasonal breakage trends, high-discount items, and high-priced SKUs
• Identify non-beverage product expansion opportunities
• Evaluate SKU overlap between datasets using Product Code matching
• Deliver actionable insights through Excel-driven dashboards and visualizations

**Key Findings**:
Coors Light, Modelo, Stella Artois led in breakage counts — potential packaging or handling issues
Breakage volumes peaked during COVID-19 (2020–2022), dropped in 2023
Vodka topped inventory by volume; Patron Silver was highest in price
Largest discount: Woodford Reserve at $183 off retail
Non-beverage items (e.g., t-shirts) offer revenue diversification potential
Datasets were successfully merged via Product Code, enabling unified reporting

**Tools & Techniques**:
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, pivot charts, dashboards
Power Query: Merge & join logic using Product Code
Slicers & Conditional Formatting: Enhanced interactivity
Custom KPIs: Breakage frequency, discount percentages, SKU classification
